# 远程唤醒

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN)

> Wake-on-LAN (WoL) is an Ethernet or Token Ring computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or awakened by a network message.
>
> The message is usually sent to the target computer by a program executed on a device connected to the same local area network, such as a smartphone. It is also possible to initiate the message from another network by using subnet directed broadcasts or a WOL gateway service.
>
> Equivalent terms include wake on WAN, remote wake-up, power on by LAN, power up by LAN, resume by LAN, resume on LAN and wake up on LAN. If the computer being awakened is communicating via Wi-Fi, a supplementary standard called Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN) must be employed.[1]
>
> The WOL and WoWLAN standards are often supplemented by vendors to provide protocol-transparent on-demand services, for example in the Apple Bonjour wake-on-demand (Sleep Proxy) feature.

> Wake-On-LAN简称WOL，是一种电源管理功能；如果存在网络活动，则允许设备将操作系统从待机或休眠模式中唤醒。许多主板厂商支持IBM提出的网络唤醒标准。该标准允许网络管理员远程打开PC机电源，以便进行文件升级、资源跟踪和设备清点等工作。
